This project aims to provide a simple but smart way for lecturers to keep track of
the topics students are struggling to understand. This is acheived by starting a session
and sharing the pin code with participants in the lecture. Students can then ask questions and
upvote each others. The questions are displayed in two lists where one is chronological while
the other shows the top upvoted.

There are currently several pending implementations to make the service more user-friendly.
The plan is to set some default parameters that can be easily changed by the host, that dictate
the number of questions each participant can ask. This is to be handles by restricting the amount
of questions a connected ID can ask during x time inverval. The restriction is lifted if the
participant recieves x amount of upvotes for the question.

The host view will also be modified to show better data, as there is no incentive for a lecturer
to receive a continuous stream of questions, but rather the ones that have gone through the filter.
