D: description - R: rate of occurence - S: severity - F: possible fix


1)
D: PSQL not returning correct time on queueries
R: always
S: severe
F: Most likely a problem caused by WSL, making PSQL unable to get the correct system time. Worked
on a cloud server when the same issue arose on last project.

2)
D: Duplicate event handler calls occuring in frontend when eventhandlers are defined outside
a function or useEffect scope.
R: always, but fixed in a hacky manner. Will most likely return.
S: Potential to be severe when accounting for operations of some scale.
F: No easy fix. Most likely a lack of understanding. Root cause should be addressed!
